TLDR:
- Copy all libs-dependencies into /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf (or equi), or symlink them
- Use -dev packages as alternative
- When running from jar, ensure folder structure containing the v4l4j lib is maintained
- Compile libv4l4j by running make inside src folder of v4l4j repo at https://github.com/mailmindlin/v4l4j
